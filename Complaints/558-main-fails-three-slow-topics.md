# Main fails three slow topics

**Status:** open

Measured on `origin/main` at f0ff751d with `python3 -m sim.tests --slow --only market_records_ownership,economy_tin_dearer_than_copper,insolvency_whole_game`:

- ~~`market_records_ownership`: "no module outside the market writes a market record" names
  `sim/engine/economy_electricity.py` writing `market_flows`.~~ Fixed: the throttle peek saves and
  restores the flows through `goods_market.snapshot_flows` / `restore_flows`.
- `economy_tin_dearer_than_copper`: tin shows far cheaper against copper than the labour its recipe embodies
  (511). Measured again on the 511 branch: tin is above its cost (about four to seven hours of wage a kilogram
  against about one hour of embodied labour); copper shows six to nine times its smelting cost, so the ratio fails
  on copper's scarcity price, not on unsold tin or gravel asks. Cash, loans, ore and plant do not bind year zero
  (the test's only year): the opening's workforce by trade and seeded `last_runs` do (smith hours in Spain are all
  hired), so a fix belongs with the opening. Later years: starved flux makers never grow (511's third update).
  Open.
- `insolvency_whole_game`: fixed (see 524): a household in arrears now lives within its income, so its debt no
  longer climbs past the credit limit and its cash rises.

A red slow suite on the default branch means every branch's slow run starts red and its own regressions are
read against noise. Each failure needs a fix or, where the subject is an open design issue, a pinned status
with the test kept honest.
- `affordability_and_credit`: fixed (test, not engine). The last section stepped twice and then read a project whose
  calendar floor is two years; on this branch the project (the dearest the founder can start on 30% of its bill) now
  finishes in the second step, on origin/main it was still active (late with arrears). Both are legitimate. The test
  now steps once, so a two-year floor leaves it active, and checks it is part-paid with cost still left.
- `economy_bronze_market_price`: the 502 check on bronze's shown price over its cost fails (worst about 2.4).
