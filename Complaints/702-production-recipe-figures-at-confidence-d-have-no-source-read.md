# Production recipe figures at confidence D have no source that was read

**Status:** open

Split from 646 (figures recalled rather than read; closed). Many recipe rows in `data/production` carry `"conf": "D"` (a
labelled guess) after passes that sourced what could be found. Count and rank by file:
`grep -rc '"conf": "D"' data/production | grep -v ":0" | sort -t: -k2 -nr`. The largest groups when this was written are
`50_chemicals.json`, `40_organics.json`, `99_lighting.json`, `80_machines.json`, `20_nonferrous.json`, the Mesoamerican stock,
game, fibre and silver files, `95_herds.json` and the gap files (`91_branch_material_gaps.json` and its numbered neighbours).
The wine, oil and jar rows belong to 656 and the stone-tool rows to 650.

**What is known already.** Searched and not found: the 2400-hour year of herders and goat and cattle head per herder
(`95_herds.json`); the Kyrenia and Olympias cargo tonnage (`99_ships.json`; Wikipedia gives a displacement, uncited);
`99_lighting.json` rows (the tallow candle burn rate has a candidate in Nature 16, 1877, p. 361, not opened); Donald and Hamblin
1976 (`95_staple_grains.json`, not openable); the Geoponica 20.46 and King, Farmers of Forty Centuries leads (not opened).

**What it would take.** Per file, read the source for each D row (author, work, page or URL, the passage) and replace the
figure, or keep it a labelled heuristic with a `retire` that names a mechanism or complaint (CLAUDE.md 4.4). A recipe yield is a
physical fact (stoichiometry, ore grade, material property), never tuned to a price (4.5).

**Research needed.** Per recipe family, the physical or experimental source: chemical process yields (an industrial chemistry
handbook for the process, with the pre-industrial route from the historical literature), lighting (candle and lamp burn rates
by fuel: experimental archaeology and photometric studies), machine builds (the hours and mass of the historical machine from
museum or engineering monographs), nonferrous refining recoveries (Craddock, Early Metal Mining and Production; Tylecote, A
History of Metallurgy), and the Mesoamerican stock, game and fibre rows (Sahagun's Florentine Codex with ethnographic yields).
