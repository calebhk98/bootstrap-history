# Regions and tiles are two maps

**Status:** open

The world has two land systems: 21 named regions and the land tiles inside
them. Soil fertility and arable land now come from tiles (Complaints/134),
and regions derive theirs from their tiles, but civilisations still hold
regions, and other data and code still work at region grain (located
materials, deposits, weather pooling, transport, geography screens).

## Why it matters

Two maps drift apart and have already disagreed (Complaints/46, 134). Every
new mechanism has to choose one, and mods have to edit both.

## What it would take

- Civilisations hold tiles (a region becomes an optional label over tiles).
- Move remaining region-level data (materials, deposits, weather) to tiles or
  derive it from them, and delete region-level copies.
- A test that no region-level field duplicates a tile-level one.
